RealTimeWorld is a custom plugin designed to synchronize the Minecraft time with the real time. It can reproduce the time, weather and moon phases of most of the cities in the world, and it is fully compatible with older versions of Minecraft. Also, **WorldGuard** is supported, meaning that you can specify more regions in a single world and have different weathers!

## Functioning

RealTimeWorld uses Google to lookup for information about a city. I decided to use Google since I did not want the user to register for any subscription in any website; however, do keep in mind that Google does not like when somebody does too many searches on their engine. This means that having **more than one instance** on the same server is highly **not advised**, unless you increase your [cities update time](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/LightFight/wiki/Configuration#cities-update-time).

## Config

The [Configuration File](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/RealTimeWorld/tree/master/config.yml) is crucial to modify the plugin behaviour. In there you will find all the main features of the plugin that control how it behaves.

## Commands


## Messages

RealTimeWorld also has a full list of messages that can be edited in the [messages file](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/RealTimeWorld/tree/master/messages.yml).

## Integrations

[WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard) is supported by the plugin and can be used to set the time for a specific region instead of a full world.
